# Exploratory Data Analysis with YouTube Video Data from Vogue

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on YouTube video data obtained from Vogue. The goal is to gain insights and understanding of working with the YouTube API.

## Project Overview

The project involves analyzing YouTube video data from Vogue, a renowned fashion and lifestyle magazine. The YouTube API is utilized to retrieve information about the videos, such as views, likes, dislikes, comments, and other relevant metrics.

The main objectives of the project are:

1. Retrieve YouTube video data using the YouTube API.
2. Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the Vogue YouTube channel.
4. Visualize the data using appropriate charts and graphs.
5. Draw meaningful conclusions and present the findings.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Python: Programming language used for data retrieval, data cleaning, and data analysis.
- YouTube Data API: Used to access the YouTube video data.
- Jupyter Notebook: Integrated development environment (IDE) for running code and documenting the analysis process.
- Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Python libraries for data visualization.
- Other standard Python libraries: NumPy, isodate, etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Obtain a YouTube Data API key from the Google Developers Console.
4. Update the API key in the code to authenticate the API requests.
5. Run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory sequentially to retrieve the data, clean it, and perform the analysis.

## Acknowledgements
